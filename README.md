# SVM Liquid Staking Contracts

StaFi's SVM Liquid Staking module serves as a comprehensive solution for token teams seeking to deploy LSD (Liquid Staking Derivatives) projects through the Staking Vault infrastructure. This powerful module delivers complete LSD functionality tailored for project teams. The system architecture features multiple stake managers and stake pools, each representing a distinct project entity managed by an authorized admin account with privileged access to configure stake manager parameters. Participants can seamlessly execute staking, unstaking, and withdrawal operations with their chosen project partner.
